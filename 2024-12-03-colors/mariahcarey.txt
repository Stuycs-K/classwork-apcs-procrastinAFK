I don't want a lot for Christ-mas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care a-bout the pres-ents un-der-neath the Christ-mas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could e-ver know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christ-mas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christ-mas, there is just one thing I need (and I)
Don't care a-bout the pres-ents un-der-neath the Christ-mas tree
I don't need to hang my stock-ing there u-pon the fire-place
San-ta Claus won't make me ha-ppy with a toy on Christ-mas Day

I just want you for my own, more than you could e-ver know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christ-mas is you
You, ba-by

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christ-mas, I won't e-ven wish for snow (and I)
I'm just go-nna keep on wait-ing un-der-neath the mist-le-toe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't e-ven stay a-wake to hear those magic rein-deer click

'Cause I just want you here to-night, hold-ing on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, ba-by, all I want for Christ-mas is you
You, ba-by, oh

All the lights are shin-ing so bright-ly eve-ry-where (so bright-ly, ba-by)
And the sound of child-ren's laugh-ter fills the air (ooh)
And eve-ry-one is sing-ing (oh yeah), I hear those sleigh bells ring-ing
San-ta, won't you bring me the one I re-ally need?
Won't you please bring my ba-by to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christ-mas, this is all I'm ask-ing for
I just wa-nna see my ba-by stand-ing right out-side my door

Oh, I just want you for my own, more than you could e-ver know
Make my wish come true
Oh, ba-by, all I want for Christ-mas is you
You, ba-by

All I want for Christ-mas is you, ba-by
All I want for Christ-mas is you, ba-by
All I want for Christ-mas is you, ba-by
All I want for Christ-mas (all I re-ally want) is you, ba-by
All I want (I want) for Christ-mas (all I re-ally want) is you, ba-by
